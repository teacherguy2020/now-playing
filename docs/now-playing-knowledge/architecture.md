# architecture

## Purpose

This page documents the structural shape of the `now-playing` project.

A stronger current interpretation is:
- the project is not a simple UI over MPD
- it is a moOde-centered enhancement system with an app-host control plane, controller/display surfaces, playback/queue mediation logic, and multiple important integration boundaries
- many visible behaviors are produced by app-host normalization and translation layers rather than by one raw source alone

So this page should act as the structural hub for the project, not as a loose conceptual overview.

## Relevant source files

This page is architectural rather than file-by-file, but these source areas are especially relevant when validating the architectural claims below:
- `moode-nowplaying-api.mjs`
- `src/routes/`
- `src/services/`
- `app.html`
- `controller.html`
- `display.html`
- `visualizer.html`
- `kiosk.html`

## Why this page matters

Agents tend to make the wrong architectural guess first.

Typical wrong guesses are:
- treating the project as mostly a static frontend
- treating MPD as the only meaningful source of truth
- treating kiosk as just another page instead of a shell mode
- treating API routes as generic plumbing instead of behavior ownership points
- treating display bugs as purely visual when they may start in state truth or runtime boundaries

This page exists to keep the high-level structure explicit before drilling into files.

## Architecture at a glance

If you only need the compressed structural model, use this:

- **Central truth hinge**: `/now-playing` and related visible-state endpoints
- **Primary control plane**: app-host API routes and route-owned behavior
- **Primary presentation layer**: controller, kiosk, and display-mode surfaces
- **Primary playback/queue layer**: playback truth, queue control, and queue shaping
- **Primary integration anchor**: moOde plus MPD, with adjacent YouTube, Alexa, radio, podcast, and Last.fm boundaries
- **Primary runtime split**: app host versus moOde host
- **Reality modifier**: local overrides and host-side patch material can materially change live behavior

## The current structural shape

A useful current structural summary is:

### 1. Central state-truth layer
The app-host API exposes central visible-truth surfaces such as:
- `/now-playing`
- `/next-up`

These are not trivial pass-through routes.
They are part of the architecture because they normalize mode-aware playback state into the payload consumed by controller/display surfaces.

### 2. App-host control plane
The app-host API is one of the project’s main architectural surfaces.
It owns:
- runtime/config control paths
- playback/queue mediation routes
- diagnostics/runtime-admin behavior
- bridge logic into moOde, MPD, YouTube, Alexa, podcasts, and other integrations

- [api-endpoint-catalog.md](api-endpoint-catalog.md)

### 3. Presentation and controller shell layer
The controller/browser family is a major UI layer, not a thin wrapper.
It owns:
- app shell behavior
- controller shell behavior
- queue interface behavior
- kiosk-backed shell behavior in `controller.html`
- embedded child-page hosting and pane logic

- [controller-tablet-anatomy.md](controller-tablet-anatomy.md)

### 4. Display / renderer layer
The display branch turns app-host truth into room-facing/browser-facing presentation.
It includes:
- display modes such as Player / Peppy / Visualizer
- kiosk as a shell/presentation mode
- launch/wrapper/helper pages such as `displays.html`
- embedded visual behavior in controller-hosted contexts

- [visualizer-in-embedded-mode.md](visualizer-in-embedded-mode.md)
- [kiosk-interface.md](kiosk-interface.md)

### 5. Playback and queue mediation layer
Queue and playback are not one flat thing.
The architecture separates:
- playback truth
- queue control
- queue shaping/curation

This is important because the queue surface, Queue Wizard, and playback authority are related but not interchangeable.

- [queue-and-playback-model.md](queue-and-playback-model.md)
- [playback-authority-by-mode.md](playback-authority-by-mode.md)
- [controller-queue-interface.md](controller-queue-interface.md)
- [queue-wizard-internals.md](queue-wizard-internals.md)

### 6. Integration boundary layer
The project continuously translates between:
- app-host truth
- moOde runtime
- MPD playback state
- YouTube
- Alexa
- radio metadata flows
- podcasts and Last.fm/scrobbling

This is architectural, not incidental.
A lot of bugs only make sense at these boundaries.

### 7. Runtime / host / environment layer
The project’s real behavior depends on host/runtime reality.
Important distinctions include:
- app host vs moOde host
- served page behavior vs host-side display effect
- normal app files vs host override material

## Architectural boundaries that matter

## API vs UI
The API is not just backend plumbing.
It is a behavior ownership layer.
Many UI surfaces are thin or moderate clients over meaningful app-host route logic.

## State truth vs presentation
A visible display/controller bug may start in:
- `/now-playing`
- `/next-up`
- mode-specific authority logic
not only in the page that renders the output.

## Shell mode vs content surface
This distinction matters especially in kiosk and embedded flows.
Examples:
- shell owner vs content owner
- queue pane shell vs queue content UI
- controller shell vs embedded child page

## Renderer vs shell mode
Player/Peppy/Visualizer are renderer/display modes.
Kiosk is a presentation/shell mode.
That split should remain architectural truth.

## What this architecture is now confident about

The current repo and wiki support these stronger claims:
- `/now-playing` is one of the central truth hinges of the system
- the app-host API is a main architectural layer, not just plumbing
- controller surfaces own significant shell and interaction behavior
- the display branch is downstream of state truth, not independent from it
- kiosk is controller-backed shell behavior, not just a separate page family
- queue/playback/queue-shaping are distinct architectural layers
- integration boundaries are core to understanding system behavior

## Relationship to other pages

This page should stay linked with:
- [system-overview.md](system-overview.md)
- [api-service-overview.md](api-service-overview.md)
- [api-state-truth-endpoints.md](api-state-truth-endpoints.md)

## Current status

At the moment, this page should be read as the structural hub for the project.

It is no longer just a conceptual layer diagram.
The current wiki already supports stronger architectural claims about:
- state truth
- control-plane ownership
- controller/display shell behavior
- queue/playback separation
- integration boundaries
- runtime/host reality.
