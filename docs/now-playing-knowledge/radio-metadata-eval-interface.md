# radio metadata eval interface

## Purpose

This page documents `now-playing/radio-eval.html`, the radio metadata evaluation console in the `now-playing` ecosystem.

This page exists because `radio-eval.html` is not a listener-facing playback UI. It is an operator/developer inspection surface for evaluating how radio stream metadata is being parsed, enriched, and judged.

It is best understood as a diagnostics-oriented quality-evaluation tool for the radio metadata pipeline.

## Why this page matters

Radio metadata is one of the most fragile parts of the broader `now-playing` system.

It sits at the boundary between:
- raw stream metadata
- parsed artist/title/album values
- enrichment/lookup attempts
- final display-quality outcomes

That makes `radio-eval.html` important because it exposes the intermediate states, not just the final now-playing result.

It gives operators a way to inspect whether radio metadata handling is:
- good enough
- partially usable
- clearly broken or misleading

## Important file

Primary file:
- `now-playing/radio-eval.html`

Related pages:
- `diagnostics-interface.md`
- `integrations.md`
- `playback-mode-troubleshooting.md`
- future radio/stream metadata pages

## High-level role

A good current interpretation is:
- `radio-eval.html` is a diagnostics/evaluation console for radio metadata quality
- it is aimed at inspecting parsing and enrichment results across recent radio log entries
- it helps assess how well the system is turning raw radio metadata into something display-worthy

## Major visible UI areas

Repo-visible structure shows a compact diagnostics layout with:
- API base field
- limit field
- refresh button
- clear-log button
- auto-refresh toggle
- status text
- tabular results area

This is clearly a live inspection console rather than a user-facing polished surface.

## Core controls

Observed controls include:
- `#apiBase`
- `#limit`
- `#refresh`
- `#clear`
- `#auto`
- `#status`
- `#rows`

These controls support both one-shot inspection and repeated live monitoring.

## Important functions / logic blocks

## `defaultApiBase()`
This function determines what API host to use by default.

Observed behavior includes:
- if current page is being served on port `8101`, default API base becomes `:3101`
- otherwise it uses the current host/origin

This reflects the familiar split between display-host/browser-served surfaces and app-host API surfaces.

## `load()`
This is the main data-loading function.

Observed behavior includes:
- read `limit`
- resolve API base
- fetch:
  - `GET /debug/radio-metadata-log?limit=<n>`
- parse returned rows
- reverse them for display
- render each row into the evaluation table
- update status with loaded count

This is the core inspection workflow.

## `verdict(r)`
This is one of the most important functions in the page.

It assigns a client-side quality verdict to each row.

Observed logic includes:
- treat entries as `GOOD` when:
  - an iTunes URL/trackUrl/albumUrl exists, or
  - the reason starts with `ok:`
- treat entries as `PARTIAL` when:
  - the reason suggests insufficient metadata, or
  - the reason includes `skip:`, or
  - parsed and raw titles are close enough to suggest partial success
- otherwise classify as `BAD`

This is a key clue that the page is meant for evaluating metadata quality heuristically, not just displaying raw logs.

## `clear` action
Observed behavior includes:
- POST to:
  - `/debug/radio-metadata-log/clear`
- expect `{ ok: true }`-style success
- reload table after clearing

This makes the page useful for repeated evaluation sessions where an operator wants to reset the sample set.

## `auto` action
Observed behavior includes:
- toggles a 5-second polling interval
- repeatedly calls `load()`
- updates button text between:
  - `Auto: Off`
  - `Auto: On (5s)`

This makes the page useful as a live-watch console while testing radio streams or metadata logic.

## What each row shows

Each rendered row includes:
- sequence/index number
- ISO time
- timestamp
- station name
- stream URL
- raw metadata fields
  - artist
  - title
  - album
- parsed metadata fields
  - artist
  - title
  - album
  - performers
- lookup/enrichment info
  - lookup term
  - reason
- final verdict/result
  - GOOD / PARTIAL / BAD
  - plus any resolved URL

That row structure is extremely valuable because it makes the transformation pipeline visible:
- raw input
- parsed interpretation
- lookup attempt
- final quality judgment

## Important API calls

Based on current inspection, the main endpoints are:
- `GET /debug/radio-metadata-log?limit=<n>`
- `POST /debug/radio-metadata-log/clear`

These appear to be diagnostics/debug endpoints rather than normal end-user app routes.

## Relationship to radio/stream handling

This page should be understood as part of the radio/stream quality branch of the project.

It is especially relevant because radio metadata handling is known to be nuanced.
The broader system already has guardrails and fallback logic around:
- weak or misleading metadata
- strict station holdback behavior
- enrichment suppression when confidence is low
- station-logo fallback behavior
- stream-specific parsing differences

`radio-eval.html` appears to be one of the concrete tools for inspecting whether those decisions are working well in practice.

## User/operator workflow model

A useful current workflow model is:

### Review workflow
1. open `radio-eval.html`
2. choose API base if needed
3. set row limit
4. refresh
5. inspect row-by-row verdicts and reasons

### Testing workflow
1. clear log
2. trigger or wait for fresh radio metadata events
3. enable auto-refresh if needed
4. inspect whether parsing and lookup behavior improved or regressed

This makes the page especially useful during stream-specific debugging and metadata-rule tuning.

## Architectural interpretation

A good current interpretation is:
- `radio-eval.html` is a debug/QA console for radio metadata transformation quality
- it is not the radio playback UI itself
- it sits closer to diagnostics and integration inspection than to normal listener control surfaces

That makes it a high-value operator page even though it is visually simple.

## Relationship to other pages

This page should stay linked with:
- `diagnostics-interface.md`
- `integrations.md`
- `playback-mode-troubleshooting.md`
- future radio/stream metadata pages
- future enrichment/lookup documentation

## Things still to verify

Future deeper verification should clarify:
- where the backing `/debug/radio-metadata-log` rows are produced in app code
- whether the iTunes-oriented fields shown here are still the primary enrichment path or only one of several
- how closely the client-side `GOOD/PARTIAL/BAD` verdict aligns with operator expectations in practice
- whether the page is used regularly during live metadata tuning or mainly as an occasional debug aid

## Current status

At the moment, this page already provides a clear view of `radio-eval.html` as a diagnostics/evaluation surface.

That is the right framing for now:
- it exposes the radio metadata pipeline
- it reveals parsing versus lookup outcomes
- it helps judge whether radio metadata is usable, questionable, or broken
