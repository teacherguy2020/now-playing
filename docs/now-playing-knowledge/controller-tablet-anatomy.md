# controller tablet anatomy

## Purpose

This page documents the internal anatomy of `now-playing/controller-tablet.html`.

It exists because `controller-tablet.html` is one of the densest and most important pages in the project.
It is not just “the tablet interface.”
It is a composite shell with:
- a now-playing header
- integrated transport controls
- quick search
- library/category entrypoints
- recent-content rails
- tablet-specific next-up and action bars
- kiosk-pane embedding behavior
- multiple modal/workflow surfaces
- strong profile/layout/device-preset logic

This page is meant to help future agents answer a question like:
- “if I need to change a specific region inside `controller-tablet.html`, where do I start?”

## Why anatomy matters here

The tablet page is exactly the kind of page where branch-level documentation is not enough.

Real tasks are likely to sound like:
- adjust the now-playing header
- change the tablet next-up bar
- improve the quick search area
- tweak the library rows
- change the recent rails
- fix the kiosk pane behavior
- change the audio info modal
- alter the live queue row actions

Those are anatomy questions, not just branch questions.

## High-level role of `controller-tablet.html`

A good current interpretation is:
- `controller-tablet.html` is a tablet-oriented controller shell
- it is also a kiosk-adjacent shell for some profiles/layouts
- it combines multiple major surface regions in one page rather than acting as only a thin frame
- it contains substantial device-preset/layout logic that materially changes behavior and structure

So this page should be understood as a multi-region orchestration shell, not just a resized controller.

## Main anatomical regions

The current page anatomy is best understood as these major regions:

1. kiosk/editor control strip
2. now-playing header card
3. integrated transport controls
4. quick search strip
5. library/category list
6. recent-content region
7. tablet next-up / action bars
8. kiosk pane iframe region
9. album / artist / audio-info modal family
10. device-preset and layout-profile logic

## 1. Kiosk/editor control strip

### What it is
This is the top control strip anchored by:
- `#kioskCtl`
- `#kioskSizeSel`
- `#kioskPushBtn`
- `#kioskPushStat`

### What it does
This region appears only in certain kiosk/editor contexts and acts as the tablet page’s local control strip for sizing/pushing kiosk-like output.

### Why it matters
It is one of the clearest places where `controller-tablet.html` overlaps with kiosk/designer/runtime-admin behavior rather than being only a tablet control shell.

### Companion pages
- `tablet-kiosk-shell-differences.md`
- `kiosk-interface.md`
- `display-launch-and-wrapper-surfaces.md`
- `display-issue-triage-runbook.md`

## 2. Now-playing header card

### What it is
The now-playing header card is the major top-left now-playing region anchored by:
- `#npCard`
- `.npTap`
- `.np`
- `#npArtWrap`
- `#art`
- `#npPersonnelBody`
- `#line1`
- `#line2`
- `#line3`
- `#line2Stars`

### What it does
This region is the tablet shell’s summary of current playback state, including:
- album art
- personnel flip card
- title/artist/album lines
- inline rating display
- podcast seek controls
- tablet-inline next-up in some layouts

### Why it matters
This is one of the most visually important parts of the page and one of the clearest places where now-playing truth, display behavior, and tablet layout logic all meet.

### Key ownership anchors
- DOM region: `#npCard`, `.np`, `#npArtWrap`
- companion pages:
  - `now-playing-surface-variants.md`
  - `playback-authority-by-mode.md`
  - `fragile-behavior-ownership.md`

## 3. Integrated transport controls

### What it is
Inside the now-playing header card, the tablet page includes a dedicated transport-control cluster anchored by:
- `#npCtrls`
- buttons with `data-np-act`

Visible actions include:
- repeat
- previous
- toggle / play-pause
- next
- pause
- play
- shuffle

### What it does
This region provides shell-local transport and playback controls rather than delegating transport entirely to another child page.

### Why it matters
This is one of the clearest reasons `controller-tablet.html` is a real controller shell rather than just a navigation page.

### Companion pages
- `queue-and-playback-model.md`
- `api-playback-and-queue-endpoints.md`
- `playback-issue-triage-runbook.md`

## 4. Quick search strip

### What it is
The quick search region is anchored by:
- `#homeQuickSearch`
- `#homeQuickKb`
- `#homeQuickClear`
- `#homeQuickResults`
- `.quickWrap`

### What it does
This is the tablet shell’s quick entrypoint for search and jump-to behavior.

### Why it matters
Quick search is one of the highest-value action areas on a tablet shell. It is also likely to interact with browse-index/local derived-state behavior rather than only raw live queries.

### Companion pages
- `queue-and-playback-model.md`
- `source-map.md`
- future deeper search/browse mapping if added later

## 5. Library/category list

### What it is
The library/category list is anchored by:
- `#libraryList`
- `.row`
- `.rowWrap`

Visible row targets include:
- Playlists
- Artists
- Albums
- Genres
- Podcasts
- Radio
- Queue Wizard
- Live Queue
- Visualizer
- Settings

### Special row behavior
The Live Queue entry has a richer wrapped row form with:
- `data-row-wrap="live-queue"`
- queue actions via `data-queue-act`

Visible row-level queue actions include:
- Vibe
- Crop
- Clear

### Why it matters
This list is not just navigation. At least some rows expose richer action behavior directly in the tablet shell.

### Companion pages
- `queue-wizard-internals.md`
- `controller-queue-interface.md`
- `kiosk-right-pane-routing.md`
- `embedded-pane-contracts.md`

## 6. Recent-content region

### What it is
The recent-content region is anchored by:
- `#recentTitle`
- `#recentRail`
- `#recentPeekRail`
- `#railModeBtn`
- `#ipadRecentGrid`
- `#ipadRailAlbums`
- `#ipadRailPodcasts`
- `#ipadRailPlaylists`
- `#ipadRailRadio`

### What it does
This region provides the tablet shell’s recent-content browsing and switching behavior.

It can behave as:
- a single rail
- a peek rail
- or a multi-pane recent grid, depending on layout/profile/device mode

### Why it matters
This is one of the strongest anatomy regions where device preset and layout mode materially reshape the page.

### Companion pages
- `tablet-interface.md`
- `tablet-kiosk-shell-differences.md`
- `fragile-behavior-ownership.md`

## 7. Tablet next-up / action bars

### What they are
The tablet page includes additional tablet-specific summary bars anchored by:
- `#tabletTopCards`
- `#tabletNextUpBar`
- `#tabletNextUpRow`
- `#tabletNextUpArt`
- `#tabletNextUpText`
- `#tabletActionBar`
- `#tabletQueuePos`
- `#tabletAudioInfoBtn`
- plus inline next-up anchors inside the now-playing card:
  - `#tabletNextUpInline`
  - `#tabletNextUpArtInline`
  - `#tabletNextUpTextInline`

### What they do
These appear to be tablet-specific summary/action regions that surface queue position, next-up state, and an audio-info entrypoint in layouts where the tablet shell has room for extra contextual bars.

### Why they matter
This is likely one of the clearest examples of the tablet page having richer shell-specific queue/playback summary behavior than other controller surfaces.

### Companion pages
- `controller-queue-interface.md`
- `playback-authority-by-mode.md`
- `playback-issue-triage-runbook.md`

## 8. Kiosk pane iframe region

### What it is
The right-pane/embedded child region is anchored by:
- `#kioskPane`
- `#kioskPaneFrame`

### What it does
This region appears to host child pages inside a pane context and is one of the tablet page’s most important orchestration features.

### Why it matters
This region is likely where the tablet shell most strongly overlaps with kiosk-style pane routing and embedded child contracts.

### Companion pages
- `embedded-pane-contracts.md`
- `kiosk-right-pane-routing.md`
- `genre-pane-messaging.md`
- `visualizer-in-embedded-mode.md`

## 9. Album / artist / audio-info modal family

### What it is
The tablet page includes multiple modal/workflow regions, including:
- `#audioInfoModal`
- `#audioInfoList`
- `#recentAlbumModal`
- `#recentAlbumTracks`
- `#recentArtistModal`
- `#recentArtistAlbumsGrid`
- related buttons like:
  - `#recentAlbumAppendBtn`
  - `#recentAlbumCropBtn`
  - `#recentAlbumReplaceBtn`
  - `#recentArtistShuffleBtn`

### What they do
These are shell-owned detail workflows for:
- audio info
- recent album drill-down
- recent artist drill-down
- album queue actions
- artist shuffle flows

### Why they matter
A request to “improve the tablet page” may actually be about one of these modal/workflow surfaces, not the main shell layout.

## 10. Device-preset and layout-profile logic

### What it is
`controller-tablet.html` contains substantial page-level logic for device presets and layout profiles.

Current visible examples include:
- `devicePreset`
- `tablet`
- `ipad11`
- `ipadModern`
- `ipadAir`
- `tabletLandscape`
- `ipad11Landscape`
- `kiosk1280`
- `kioskEditor`

### What it does
This logic materially changes:
- grid structure
- card sizing
- recent-rail layout
- art/control placement
- next-up/action-bar visibility
- embedded pane behavior
- kiosk/editor control behavior

### Why it matters
This is one of the biggest reasons `controller-tablet.html` needs anatomy documentation. Many visible regions are not static; they are profile-sensitive.

### Companion pages
- `tablet-kiosk-shell-differences.md`
- `kiosk-interface.md`
- `display-surface-troubleshooting.md`
- `display-issue-triage-runbook.md`

## Practical “where do I start?” map

### If asked to improve the tablet now-playing header
Open first:
- `#npCard`
- `.np`
- `#npArtWrap`
- `#line1`, `#line2`, `#line3`
- transport controls under `#npCtrls`

### If asked to improve the tablet next-up area
Open first:
- `#tabletNextUpBar`
- `#tabletNextUpText`
- `#tabletNextUpInline`
- queue/playback companion pages

### If asked to improve quick search
Open first:
- `.quickWrap`
- `#homeQuickSearch`
- `#homeQuickResults`
- search/browse-related shell logic

### If asked to improve the library/category list
Open first:
- `#libraryList`
- `.row`
- `.rowWrap`
- special Live Queue row action wiring

### If asked to improve recent rails or recents layout
Open first:
- `#recentRail`
- `#recentPeekRail`
- `#ipadRecentGrid`
- device-preset/layout logic that changes recent-region structure

### If asked to improve right-pane embedded behavior
Open first:
- `#kioskPane`
- `#kioskPaneFrame`
- embedded-pane contract and kiosk routing companions

### If asked to improve album/artist/audio info modal behavior
Open first:
- `#audioInfoModal`
- `#recentAlbumModal`
- `#recentArtistModal`
- related action buttons and modal population logic

## Anatomy rule for future agents

For `controller-tablet.html`, do not assume a requested change belongs to only one of these buckets:
- layout/CSS only
- playback logic only
- embedded child page only
- kiosk logic only

Always classify the target first:
- shell region
- shell region with route-backed state
- shell-owned modal/workflow
- embedded child pane
- device-preset/layout-profile behavior

That classification step should save a lot of wrong first guesses.

## Relationship to other pages

## Current status

At the moment, this page gives the wiki its second real page-anatomy reference.

Its main job is to make explicit that `controller-tablet.html` is not just a tablet-themed controller page.
It is a multi-region orchestration shell with:
- now-playing header behavior
- integrated transport
- quick search
- category navigation
- recent-rail browsing
- tablet-specific next-up/action regions
- pane embedding
- modal workflows
- and heavy device-preset/layout logic.
