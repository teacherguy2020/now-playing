# Queue Wizard

![Queue Wizard tab](./images/05-queue-wizard.jpg)

Queue Wizard is the composition engine for curated or generated queues.

## Builders
- **Playlists Queue Builder**: select existing playlists and send to moOde.
- **Filter Queue Builder**: constrain by genres/artists/albums/exclusions.
- **Vibe Queue Builder**: generate from now-playing context (Last.fm-assisted flow).

## Modes and toggles
- Replace vs Add
- Crop queue
- Random (selection behavior)

## Output
- send directly to moOde queue
- save generated set as playlist (+ optional cover flow in related paths)

## Usage tip
Treat this tab as "batch intent" and keep transport controls in hero for immediate playback tweaks.
