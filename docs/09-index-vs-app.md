# index.html vs app.html

Purpose: clarify differences and required parity points.

## index.html
- dedicated display surface
- full-screen now-playing focus

## app.html
- shell with tab iframe + hero transport
- queue card and admin context

## Required parity
- Alexa mode detection
- Next-up semantics
- random/repeat state display
